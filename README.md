Employee Management System Analysis using SQL
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and analysis of an Employee Management System using SQL. The primary objective is to manage organisational data efficiently and derive meaningful insights that support business and HR decision-making.

The system is built using a relational database approach, where employee-related data such as employee details, departments, job roles, salaries, attendance, and performance information is stored in a structured and normalised format. Proper relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and consistency.
